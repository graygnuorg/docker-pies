# This file provides definitions for building various versions of
# GNU pies container.
#
# Each definition begins with `build=NAME' and ends with a formfeed
# character.  Any number of variable assignments can appear between
# them.  A variable assignment starting with 'os ' is special.  It
# defines a version of the OS (distro, actually) to use for that
# particular build.  A missing 'os' entry stands for 'latest'.
#
# Empty lines and comments are ignored.
# Whitespace characters are allowed at either side of the = operator.
